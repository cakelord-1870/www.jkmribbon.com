Brenda Manges Papadakis has lovingly recreated the two hundred twenty five patterns from the celebrated Jane A. Blakely Stickle quilt. Accompanying the patterns are a remarkable series of letters from Brenda to Jane, drawing us into the historical context of Jane's achievement and connecting her to our quilting lives today. Among the patterns and letters you will find a dozen quilts from the 1990's, all inspired by Jane's supreme example of quiltmaking artistry in 1863. Brenda's meticulous research has been a devoted labor of love, not only for a splendid quilt but also for the woman who created it. You will be moved by her letters to Jane, and enlightened about the times in which she lived. You will also be kept delightfully busy with the large collection of block which challenge you to create your own Baby Jane quilt. *© 2002 EZ Quilting® by Wrights® West Warren, MA 01092\u003cbr\u003e(Product Characteristic: How To Books; Kits) \/ (Fabric Content: 100% Paper)\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Wrights","offers":[{"title":"As Shown \/ 1 Pc\/Pkg; 1 Pkg\/Box \/ As Shown","offer_id":1063637188629,"sku":"MR882670199","price":16.05,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2224\/9099\/products\/x882670199-wrights.jpg?v=1512837719"},{"product_id":"wrights-easy-dresden","title":"Wrights Easy Dresden","description":"\u003cp\u003eOur easy dresden comes with 1 piece per package. 3 packages per box.

Designed by Darlene Zimmerman, the ruler is marked in black for right handed users and in red for left handed users. The markings are in 1\/4\" increments and the numbers read correctly any way the ruler is turned. There are 45 degree lines for centering when squaring up blocks. This ruler is useful for cutting squares and trimming blocks to size.\u003cbr\u003e(Product Characteristic: Sewing; Quilting Tools) \/ (Fabric Content: Not Available)\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Wrights","offers":[{"title":"4 1\/2\" \/ 1 Pc\/Pkg; 3 Pkgs\/Box \/ As Shown","offer_id":1064061009941,"sku":"MR8828001","price":19.85,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2224\/9099\/products\/x8828001-wrights.jpg?v=1512841151"},{"product_id":"wrights-3-in-1-gauge","title":"Wrights 3 in 1 Gauge","description":"\u003cp\u003e3 in 1 Gauge is available 1 piece per package and comes 3 packages per box.\u003cbr\u003e(Product Characteristic: Sewing; Quilting Tools) \/ (Fabric Content: Not Applicable)\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Wrights","offers":[{"title":"As Shown \/ 1 Pc\/Pkg; 3 Pkgs\/Box \/ 001 As Shown","offer_id":1064061829141,"sku":"MR3401003001","price":7.73,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2224\/9099\/products\/x3401003001-wrights-2011.jpg?v=1512841166"},{"product_id":"wrights-yarn-talkers","title":"Wrights Yarn Talkers","description":"\u003cp\u003eYarn Talkers is available 1 piece per package and comes 3 packages per box.\u003cbr\u003e(Product Characteristic: Sewing; Quilting Tools) \/ (Fabric Content: Not Applicable)\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Wrights","offers":[{"title":"As Shown \/ 1 Pc\/Pkg; 3 Pkgs\/Box \/ 079 Yellow","offer_id":1064061894677,"sku":"MR3412001079","price":5.05,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2224\/9099\/products\/x3412001079-wrights-2011.jpg?v=1512841169"},{"product_id":"wrights-circular-knit-talley-counter","title":"Wrights Circular Knit Talley Counter","description":"\u003cp\u003eCircular Knit Talley Counter is available 1 piece per package and comes 3 packages per box.\u003cbr\u003e(Product Characteristic: Sewing; Quilting Tools) \/ (Fabric Content: Not Applicable)\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Wrights","offers":[{"title":"As Shown \/ 1 Pc\/Pkg; 3 Pkgs\/Box \/ 000 As Shown","offer_id":1064061927445,"sku":"MR3417347000","price":7.55,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2224\/9099\/products\/x3417347000-wrights-2011.jpg?v=1512841172"},{"product_id":"wrights-hairpin-lace-tool","title":"Wrights Hairpin Lace Tool","description":"\u003cp\u003eHairpin Lace Tool is availabe 1 piece per package and comes 3 packages per box.\u003cbr\u003e(Product Characteristic: Sewing; Quilting Tools) \/ (Fabric Content: Not Applicable)\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Wrights","offers":[{"title":"As Shown \/ 1 Pc\/Pkg; 3 Pkgs\/Box \/ B01 Natural","offer_id":1064061992981,"sku":"MR3707405B01","price":9.81,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2224\/9099\/products\/x3707405B01-wrights-2011.jpg?v=1512841175"},{"product_id":"wrights-no-melt-mylar-template","title":"Wrights No Melt Mylar Template","description":"\u003cp\u003eNo Melt Mylar Template is available in 12\"x18\" Width 1 Pc\/Pkg, 25 Pkgs\/Box is available in 50 Pcs\/Pkg, 3 Pkgs\/Box\u003cbr\u003e(Product Characteristic: Sewing; Quilting Tools) \/ (Fabric Content: Not Available)\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Wrights","offers":[{"title":"12\"x18\" \/ 1 Pc\/Pkg; 25 Pkgs\/Box \/ 050 As Shown","offer_id":1066017751061,"sku":"MR882670050","price":71.32,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"As Shown \/ 50 Pcs\/Pkg; 3 Pkgs\/Box \/ 160 As Shown","offer_id":1066017816597,"sku":"MR882670160","price":5.07,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2224\/9099\/products\/x882670050-wrights.jpg?v=1512854612"}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2224\/9099\/collections\/sewing-quilting-notions.jpg?v=1510886180","url":"https:\/\/www.jkmribbon.com\/collections\/sewing-quilting-notions.oembed","provider":"JKM Ribbon \u0026 Trims","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
